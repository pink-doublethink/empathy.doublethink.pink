### What is the project about?
---
- This project was created to show the reader how amazing, vibrant and deep can be painted miniatures. When creating the site I tested and evaluated the latest CSS properties such as the :has selector, container properties, layers and CSS nesting.

- Photographic material is taken from public media sources where artists share and discuss their own and others' work.
